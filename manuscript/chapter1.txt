## Introduction

I felt it was prudent to choose this topic for this project because very few others could provide as in-depth an account of the history of the Digital Forensics Discord Server. Having been apart of the server since day one, and actively monitoring every day since, I felt like this was something that needed to be immortalized before too much more time passes. As the server continues to grow, and life forges on, much like a DVR or event log, memories are overwritten with more current memories and I very likely would not be able to write as detaied of an account of this server’s history 5 years from now as I am today. If anything, by documenting this history now, it can serve as a starting point to build upon over time.

## Beginnings in IRC

Long before the Digital Forensics Discord Server came to be, there existed a channel on an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) network called [freenode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode). The channel was called `#mobileforensics`. This channel had its humble beginnings on a Google Group run by Bob Elder of [TeelTech](https://www.teeltech.com/), called the [Physical and RAW Mobile Forensics Group](https://groups.google.com/g/physical-mobile-forensics/about?pli=1), which still exists today. To gain access to this Google Group, one had to have attended a TeelTech training in the past. It was and continues to be a phenomenal resource for those in Law Enforcement trying to navigate the waters of mobile forensic acquisitions.

By way of background, In February 2016, I attended the JTAG/Chip-Off class by TeelTech taught by Mike Boettcher and gained an invite to the Physical and RAW Mobile Forensics Group. I actively participated in the group to the extent my knowledge and curiosity enabled me. Make no mistake, almost every other active poster in that group was more experienced or knowledgeable than me. However, I thought there was no better place or group of people to immerse myself in than this group if I wanted to be the best version of myself.

On August 23, 2016, a user that went by the name of `tupperwarez` had informed the group that they were starting an IRC channel called `#mobileforensics` in an effort "exchange ideas & have live discussions", as the post stated.

I have been using forums for all of my internet life up until this point, and I think subconsciously I was ready for something more, and this was it! I also knew that IRC was a longstanding tradition but I had never dabbled with it as I only had previous experience with messaging clients such as [AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)) and [MSN Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Messenger) at the time. 13 minutes after the post went out by `tupperwarez`, I was the first to respond in the thread that I had joined.

Throughout the next year and a half, a small contingent of people totaling anywhere from 7-15 at any given time occupied this IRC channel. We became a tight-knit group of examiners who relied on each other's knowledge and expertise to navigate challenges in our everyday casework. These problems often would relate to performing advanced acquisition methods using Chip-Off, JTAG, or flasher boxes. The collaboration was exactly what I was looking for because through each other we were able to cast a wider net for knowledge that we sought for problems we were coming across in our everyday investigations.

I recall utilizing an application called [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/) to access this IRC channel. I'd have HexChat open at all times along with my everyday workflow of software applications to perform my duties as a Detective. For those reading this who have not used IRC before, know that's its nowhere near as feature rich as Discord. Discord is much more modern and IRC has been around since the "early days" of the internet as we know it today. I bring this up because often we needed to share pictures with each other as an exhibit for a problem we were encountering during the acquisition or decoding process of a mobile device.

## Move to Discord

Truthfully, I had forgotten this detail I'm about to share but one of the moderators reminded me of it a couple of years ago and it all came back to me. One of the main catalysts for moving from IRC was the fact that I was really annoyed with having to upload a picture to imgur and share the link on the IRC channel as it seemed inefficient and the process grew stale for me. I had created a Discord account back in September 2016 to join various special interest servers so I had a fair amount of exposure to Discord's capabilities prior to the birthdate of the Digital Forensics Discord Server, which is March 26th, 2018.

I recall having aspirations for a move to Discord months prior to March 2018. For those who didn't use Discord around this time, it was primarily a platform marketed towards gamers. Using it for things other than gaming wasn't the intended purpose at the time, but the functionality it had was everything I wanted in a chat client. Take all of the good features from every other chat application I had used up until that point in time and add even more quality of life features and an awesome mobile application, and I was sold. I didn't like how it wasn't as seamless to use IRC on my phone and combined with the inefficient image uploading process, Discord was a breath of fresh air.

I was reminded that the major push to move to Discord came from me mostly surrounding the image uploading process combined with the positive experiences I had with the platform in my personal life via special interest servers from September 2016 to March 2018. The call to move to Discord was met with nearly unanimous approval from members of the IRC channel. As a result, the Mobile Forensics Discord Server was created!

## Mobile Forensics Discord Server => Digital Forensics Discord Server

The Mobile Forensics Discord Server enjoyed great success and rapid growth throughout its first year of existence. The server's growth was entirely driven by word of mouth and advertising on various Google Groups. The list of channels maintained in the server were driven by member requests which quickly expanded outside of mobile devices. Over time, it became increasingly apparent that branding the server as a Mobile Forensics server did not fully encompass the needs of the DFIR community. To the best of my research, the Mobile Forensics Discord Server was rebranded to the Digital Forensics Discord Server sometime around February 2019.

Since then, multiple channels have been added, renamed, and removed at the request of members.

## Hosting the 2020 Magnet Virtual Summit

In early 2020, shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic began, I was approached by representatives from Magnet Forensics inquiring about the possibility of providing a centralized location for attendees of the Magnet Virtual Summit 2020 to chat during presentations. Enthusiastically, we accepted the idea and began to plan the logistics of hosting what likely would become a large influx of members. I seem to recall nearly 1500 members joining during the month long Magnet Virtual Summit 2020.

In retrospect, it's clear that this was one of the first indicators that the server had "made it" in the eyes of the community. Not only was the 2020 Magnet Virtual Summit as massive success in many ways, but I also strongly feel its success influenced other conferences and entities to go virtual as well as adopt Discord for the means of communication for attendees. For instance, the SANS 2020 DFIR Summit hosted a Discord server for their attendees a couple months after the 2020 Magnet Virtual Summit hosted on the Digital Forensics Discord Server. I would like to think of the 2020 Magnet Virtual Summit as a proof of concept in collaboration and communication between conference staff, presenters and attendees that succeeded beyond our expectations and influenced in one way or another how conferences were virtualized in 2020 and beyond.

## Community Engagement Within the Server

One of the biggest divides that the Digital Forensics Discord Server was able to bridge was that between customers and vendors. I recall spending a lot of time emailing every vendor I knew of to provide representation in the server due to untapped potential in customer and vendor communications that simply didn't exist at the time. 4 years into the life of the server, multiple representatives from multiple digital forensic software vendors are mainstays in the respective channels related to their products providing an unprecedented amount of instant feedback between the customer and the vendor. Historically, support was provided by email via a ticketing system, a vendor's forum, or another means that lacked the instant feedback mechanism that Discord provides. Not only are customers able to interact directly with digital forensic software vendors employees that can provide meaningful answers to help move a case forward, but they can also receive product feedback and observe interactions between examiners (aka their customers) and better understand how their respective product(s) can improve to better server those using their products.

I know I have no possible way to quantify this statement, but I would like to think overall there has been a net positive influence on commonly utilized digital forensic software as a result of this direct interaction with the customer base within the Digital Forensic Discord Server's channels.

## Impact on the DFIR community

In this section, I want to share some unique stories from people who have joined the Digital Forensics Discord Server and what impact it has had on them.

One of the earliest stories I can remember is from someone who identified themselves as a detective in Alaska. Specifically, this person stated they worked at a police department in a remote part of Alaska and they were a one-man digital forensics team. They did not have another technically savvy person to run ideas past that was less than 3 hours away from them by car. Upon joining the Digital Forensics Discord Server, they stated that the community provided exactly what they needed as prior to joining the server they were operating solo with no one to bounce ideas off of when challenges arose in their investigations. When I was a detective, I had at least 2 other people in my office to run ideas past or ensure I wasn't forgetting something simple whenever I ran into a roadblock in my analysis. I simply cannot imagine having my closest support being over 3 hours away from me. I can only imagine the feeling of isolation. This person stated the the Digital Forensics Discord Server was a game changer for them in that it provided something they so desperately needed: support!

Another story I can think of was more recent in that someone from a country I had never expected to have to make a Law Enforcement role for had joined the server. Someone posted in the `#role-assignment` channel stating they were a police officer in Iraq. In a prior life, I was in the United State Marine Corps and I had actually served a combat tour in Iraq in the infantry back in 2006-2007. Never in a million years would I have imagined that someone from Iraq serving in Law Enforcement would join the Digital Forensics Discord Server. To this day, this person is the only one occupying the `Law Enforcement [Iraq]` role, but I have to say particularly for me that this person joining the server was a "coming full circle moment for me. I engaged in conversation with this individual and asked for updates on how the country was doing and it really warmed my heart, in all honesty. I've met so many wonderful people in that country during my 7 month deployment and to think that the country is in a place to where they're catching up with the 70 other countries who have roles within the server was something that put a smile on my face and still does to this day.

## Law Enforcement Personnel

Being former Law Enforcement myself, I understand the importance of jurisdiction and how laws can differ from one jurisdiction to another. As a result, Law Enforcement roles were separated by country from the early stages of the server for the purpose of delineating members from each other due to various legal considerations that may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Because of that, enumerating a list of the countries that a Law Enforcement role has been created for is likely the best way to establish the reach the Digital Forensics Discord Server has had on the DFIR community on a global level. Countries with roles assigned for Law Enforcement personnel are listed below:

| As of July 2022: |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Albania            | India       | Nigeria              |
| Argentina          | Indonesia   | Norway               |
| Australia          | Iran        | Pakistan             |
| Austria            | Iraq        | Poland               |
| Bangladesh         | Ireland     | Portugal             |
| Belgium            | Israel      | Romania              |
| Bosnia             | Italy       | Royal Cayman Islands |
| Brazil             | Jamaica     | Russia               |
| Canada             | Japan       | Senegal              |
| Chile              | Korea       | Seychelles           |
| China              | Latvia      | Singapore            |
| Columbia           | Lithuania   | Slovakia             |
| Croatia            | Luxembourg  | Slovenia             |
| Cyprus             | Malaysia    | Spain                |
| Czech Republic     | Maldives    | Sweden               |
| Denmark            | Malta       | Switzerland          |
| Dominican Republic | Mauritius   | Taiwan               |
| Estonia            | Mexico      | Turkey               |
| Finland            | Monaco      | Ukraine              |
| France             | Mongolia    | United Arab Emirates |
| Germany            | Myanmar     | United Kingdom       |
| Greece             | Nepal       | Uruguay              |
| Grenada            | Netherlands | USA                  |
| Iceland            | New Zealand | Vietnam              |

To save you from counting, that's 72 countries with a dedicated Law Enforcement role. This means that someone who has identified themselves as someone who works in Law Enforcement in one of these countries has joined the server and had this role assigned to them. At least 1 person from each of these countries that at the time served in a Law Enforcement capacity have joined the Digital Forensics Discord Server. With [195 countries](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-countries-are-in-the-world.html) recognized in the world as of the writing of this book, the server has a reach into approximately 37% of those!

## Future

The Digital Forensics Discord Server will continue to live and thrive so long as the community wills it. I will always be active in the server, but this server is and always has been far more than any single person. As long as the members of the DFIR community keep showing up and engaging with each other, the Digital Foreniscs Discord Server will never die...unless Discord ceases to exist which would likely call for the community to migrate to a different platform. Let’s hope that doesn’t happen anytime soon!

Regardless, all indications point to the the server continuing to grow through coworker word of mouth, exposure through training courses, and university programs sharing invites to the server to students. The server has always been welcoming of all walks of life, from the high school student wanting to work in DFIR someday to people who’ve been involved in DFIR for decades, and everywhere in between. This will not ever change.

### Adminstrator Contingency Plan

This server is has become such an important part of my life (and the DFIR community) that I’ve created a contingency plan. For those who are new to administering Discord servers, one important thing to know is that only the member who is assigned as the Server Owner can delete the server. Currently, that person is me, Andrew Rathbun. In the interest of ensuring the Digital Forensics Discord Server lives far beyond all of us (assuming Discord is still around by that time), I've established a paper trail for any other moderators to follow should anything happen to me to where I will never be able to log back in to Discord. This paper trail will require a lot of effort and coordination with family members/friends of mine to access my password vault and many other necessary items in order to [Transfer Ownership](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/216273938-How-do-I-transfer-server-ownership) so that the server can live on without any administrative hiccups. In the unfortunate event that I can no longer log back into Discord, a OneNote page has been shared with other moderators providing breadcrumbs to obtain the necessary information to transfer ownership to another moderator so the server can be properly taken care of.

## Conclusion

Thank you to everyone who has helped this server become such an integral part of the DFIR community.
