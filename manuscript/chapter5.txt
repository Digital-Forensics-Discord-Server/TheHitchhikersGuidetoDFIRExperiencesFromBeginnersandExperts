## Overview:

This chapter provides a cursory overview of Android application analysis through automated and manual methods followed by a methodology of adjusting to scale.

## Introduction:

Mobile forensics, specifically as it pertains to Android devices, tends to focus a little more heavily on application analysis during the initial evaluation. Unlike Windows systems, the sandbox nature of the devices (assuming they aren’t and/or can’t be easily rooted), makes it a little more difficult gain a deeper forensic image without first compromising an existing application (such as malicious webpages targeting exploits in Chrome or through hijacking an insecure update process in a given application), utilizing a debugging or built in adminsitrative function, or through installing an application with greater permissions (both methods would still require privilege escalation to root). A typical stock Android phone typically has at least between 60-100+ applications installed at a given time while recent phones have more than 100+. This includes system applications maintained by Google, device/manufacturer applications such as with Huawei or Samsung, and network provider applications such as with Sprint, Vodafone, or Verizon. Additionally, device manufacturers and network provides typically have agreements with various companies, such as Facebook, to preinstall their application during device provisioning. Most of these applications cannot be easily pulled during forensic analysis without utilizing some method of physical extraction (i.e., use of Qualcomm Debugger functionality) or root access.

## Part 1 - Automated Analysis

If during a forensic analysis you are lucky enough to get all of the Android applications resident on the system, you are left with the problem of analyzing more than 100+ applications. Most Android application analysis tools typically are developed to do automated analysis of individual applications with some ability to do a comparative analysis of two APKs. In this space, [MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) is considered one of the most popular application analysis tools. This tool does provide a method for dynamically generating an automated analysis of various APKs with varying level of success with both automated static and dynamic analysis. Installation of this tool is fairly easy and the developer has fairly robust documentation.

T> (Please refer to: https://mobsf.github.io/docs/#/installation) for the most up to date instructions. The installation instructions following works at the moment:

{line-numbers:false}
```
    sudo apt-get install git python3.8 openjdk-8-jdk python3-dev python3-venv python3-pip build-essential libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg8-dev  zlib1g-dev wkhtmltopdf
    git clone https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git
    cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
    sudo ./setup.sh
```

W> If you plan on installing this on a VM, please note that dynamic analysis is not really supported. If you were able to modify MobSF to run in a VM, there is signficant probability of specific functionality failing to properly execute and any results would not be consistent or trustworthy. Personally, I use my own virtualized environment separate from MobSF which will potentially be discussed in another guide.

![](resources/Ch5/2.png)

Once installed, you can run MobSF with the following simple command within the MobSF directory <Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF>.

{line-numbers:false}
```
    ./run.sh
```

Additionally, you can specify the listening address and listening port as MobSF starts its own web server for user interaction. The following default setting will be used if the command is started without arguments:

{line-numbers:false}
```
    0.0.0.0:8000
```

Example post run:

Accessing the hosted webpage with your favorite browser shows the following webpage:

![](resources/Ch5/4.png)

From here, you can upload the binary to the MobSF instance in your virtual machine:

![](resources/Ch5/5.png)

From here, most times the webpage will time out so click `Recent Scans` which shows the following:

![](resources/Ch5/6.png)

Because we are in a VM, the dynamic report will be unavailable but the static report should provide the primary details for initial triage of the application. After a few minutes and depending on the size of the application, the report will be ready for analysis:

![](resources/Ch5/7.png)

Now for analysis of malware, there are a number of websites hosting samples for training and tool development but I have typically found [vx-underground.org](https://www.vx-underground.org/) fairly robust.

![](resources/Ch5/8.png)

The malware needs to be extracted with the password `infected` and renamed with the extension `.apk`. The scan by MobSF showed the following details:

![](resources/Ch5/9.png)

There are two options to view either a Static Report or Dynamic Report. Because we are in a virtual machine, there will not be an available Dynamic report. The Static Report shows the following information:

![](resources/Ch5/10.png)

Outside of the calculated hashes, the actual information needed for an assessment is further down:

![](resources/Ch5/11.png)

The section in the above right shows that MobSF stored the decompiled Java code which can be compared to the results and referenced later. The section below shows the signing certificate has an unusual xuhang string in almost all of the issuer information. The next section of interest is related to the requested permissions:

![](resources/Ch5/12.png)

Permissions such as `MOUNT_UNMOUNT_FILESYSTEMS` for what appears to be a game looks incredibly unusual.

Other sections of interest include various API functions that could potentially indicate application capabilities.

![](resources/Ch5/13.png)

For example, clicking on the `com/g/bl.java` shows the following code segment:

![](resources/Ch5/14.png)

Generally speaking, the function to pass commands to `/system/bin/sh` should be scrutinized and typically is indicative of malicious intent. This isn’t always the case as applications that provide system functionality typically use sh as a means to use native Android OS tools such as ping.

Another area of concern is the collection and sending of sensitive device information to include the IMSI and wireless MAC address:

![](resources/Ch5/15.png)

While the functions and information accessed appear malicious, it would be prudent to validate any suppositions with actual evidence of malicious intent. The additional analysis is beyond the scope of this initial writeup but is typical to most malware analysis methodologies.

## Part 2 - Manual Analysis

Now that we have done some initial analysis of an APK with an automate tool such as MobSF, let’s dive into doing some manual analysis using [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx). JADX is an APK decompiler that converts compiled APKs and DEX files into readable decomplied code. The source code and compiled releases for JADX provides both a CLI and GUI based application that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. After opening one of the APKs within JADX a breakdown of the stored decompiled code, resources, and embedded files can be seen:

![](resources/Ch5/16.png)

Whether malicious or not, most Android applications have some level of obfuscation. In this case, the major programmatic functionality is not obfuscated but the names of the classes (a, b, c, etc.) do not have significant meaning and can make initial analysis more difficult:

![](resources/Ch5/17.png)

One area that should be checked is the APK signature and certificate details:

![](resources/Ch5/18.png)

This matches what MobSF had reported. It is possible to get differing results from different tools so double/triple checking relevant details is important.

Another area for analysis is the `AndroidManifest.XML` file stored within the Resources folder structure:

![](resources/Ch5/19.png)

Here we see the same significant number of permissions along with some third-party application app keys which appear to be directly associated to the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/angcyo/umeng. Interestingly, the following topic on Alibaba cloud references both the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission as required to dynamically update APKs using UMENG and the associated APPKEY: https://topic.alibabacloud.com/a/use-umeng-to-automatically-update-apk-and-umeng-apk_1_21_32538466.html.

![](resources/Ch5/20.png)

This obviously has the implication, if true, that even if there is not malicious logic baked directly into the application during dynamic and static analysis that the application could be manipulated at any later time. Beyond this initial triage is out of scope for the write up but this portion of analysis is important to highlight the need for manual analysis and need to read contextual clues. Any automation should be validated and checked regardless of scaling.

While usually successful, it should be noted that JADX cannot always decompile the compiled code to Java and any errors should be parsed to ensure that the uncompiled code does not have any malicious logic. The following screenshot shows a typical de-compilation error:

![](resources/Ch5/21.png)

The concept of this writeup was to provide a cursory analysis of a piece of malware that would provide the foundation of automating large scale analysis of APKs. The foundation begins at minimum with some of the above techniques (permissions and signatures) but also on basic threat hunting aspects such as searching for various exploitation techniques and indicators of compromise. In that sense, hard coded references to `/system/bin/sh`, hard coded IP addresses, and unusual permissions are fairly easy using the built-in search functionality:

![](resources/Ch5/22.png)

I would recommend enabling searching within comments as sometimes additional functionality using external APIs and websites are simply commented out but otherwise accessible.

## Problem of Scale:

So far, we have covered the bare basics of using MobSF to analyze an APK as well as how to manually interrogate the same APK using JADX. In most malware mobile forensic investigations with physical access (not logical) most stock Android phones have more than 100+ APKs (including system applications, device manufacturer applications, network provider applications, and third-party applications) that could need to be analyzed. Devices in active usage could reach beyond 200+ APKs that could potentially need to be analyzed. 200+ APKs is a significant number of applications for a malware forensic analysis but the investigation could be completed using MobSF and JADX in a few weeks. The problem comes at scale by expanding the number of devices being analyzed. Now you may have 100+ devices, each with 100+ APKs that may or may not be the same version. This quickly becomes untenable which results in a need to develop or adapt mobile application analysis methodology to scale.

## Part 3 - Using Autopsy, Jadx, and Python to Scrap and Parse Android Applications at Scale

The last scenario isn’t a hypothetical one, it is one that I had to adjust and adapt methodology for. To start with the forensic analysis, you need to have an Android image to work with. If you have one saved from a test device using Cellebrite that can be used to test and develop the solution at scale. If you don’t, you can simply pull a virtual machine from [osboxes.org](https://www.osboxes.org/android-x86/). Keep in mind there are significant differences between x86 and ARM architectures and Android versions so don’t be hyper specific in file locations and file names.

T> Pro-Tip: Using an Android VM (either from osboxes.org or another source) along with a host-only network adapter can allow you to capture and manipulate network traffic (including some SSL encrypted traffic) by using your brand of network collection ([Security Onion](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion) or simple [WireShark](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark)) and a MiTM proxy with SSLStrip ([[BetterCap](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap)). Combined with a code injection tool with memory reading capabilities ([Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida)) this can be the foundation of more advanced dynamic analysis methodologies.

Once you have the appropriate image file (vmdk, bin, img, etc.), you can create a new case within Autopsy:

![](resources/Ch5/23.png)

Select Disk Image or VM file as seen below:

![](resources/Ch5/24.png)

Select the appropriate image file:

![](resources/Ch5/25.png)

Select the appropriate Ingest Modules (you can leave this default for now; we will come back here).

![](resources/Ch5/26.png)

Continue through the default options until the data source is ingested as seen below:

![](resources/Ch5/27.png)

At this point we have the basic test and development case setup. Now it is time to start developing a solution to the problem of scale. The first portion of the problem is to find a relatively simple and automated solution to pull APK files from data sources. Autopsy has a specific capability that it allows you to use specifically designed Python plugins to automate such tasks. By using public examples (such as https://github.com/markmckinnon/Autopsy-Plugins), I modified one of the simpler Python scripts to search for and flag files with the `.apk` extension (amongst others):

![](resources/Ch5/28.png)

>C **Please Note** In the script referenced above is a hardcoded file location to pull the found files to. This must be modified to match your system. Dynamically pulling the folder location appeared too difficult at the time due to Autopsy using modified Python methods that are cross compiled into Java (things get weird). Additionally, the following [wiki](http://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/api-docs/4.9.0/) hasn't really been updated so a significant amount of testing is needed.  To aid in your troubleshooting, the location of the log file can be accessed by going to the case folder:

![](resources/Ch5/29.png)

Going to the log folder:

![](resources/Ch5/30.png)

Finally, opening one of the plain text log files:

![](resources/Ch5/31.png)

Unfortunately, this file is locked while Autopsy is running and you must close Autopsy to view any associated error.

Once a Python script has been developed and tested, you have to manually add in the Python plugin to the appropriate folder. A simple link can be accessed from the menu option below:

![](resources/Ch5/32.png)

To add the python plugin, you simply move an appropriate named folder structure containing the python modules into the following directory:

![](resources/Ch5/33.png)

Now simply restart Autopsy and right click the data source you wish to run the plugin against:

![](resources/Ch5/34.png)

Similar to before, if all is well a new option should be present:

![](resources/Ch5/35.png)

Now simply click `Deselect All` (since they have already run) and click your custom tool. If you are using a barebones osboxes VM it would be prudent to add some various APKs. Once the module finished running you should see the following:

![](resources/Ch5/36.png)

So now we have a way to automate scraping of APK files, to continue now we need to do some rudimentary analysis. Remember how JADX had a CLI? This functionality can help decompile the APKs fairly quickly allowing for additional analysis using REGEX, individual file hashing, and other forensicating things. In this situation,I developed a companion script using Python (YAAAAT_apk_ripper) that has embedded the functionalities required for my use case:

![](resources/Ch5/37.png)

The following code section shows the functionality of running JADX and dumping the output to the `case_extract` folder:

![](resources/Ch5/38.png)

This script works by iteratively going through the `case_extract/apk` folder structure and attempts to be fairly fault tolerant in the case of incorrect file extension or file corruption.

Beyond the simple JADX decompiling functionality, additional functions can be added by analyzing the code sections of the decompiled APK using REGEX:

![](resources/Ch5/39.png)

The above code section attempts to find high confidence URLs within the code base and extract the information to a mapped log file for manual analysis. There are other regex solutions to map out potential URLs which helps mitigate missing aspects of URL crafting.

Besides JADX, to parse embedded certificates (for APK signature analysis and potential Certificate pinning implmenetations) the script incorporates Java keytool if Java JDK is present and some methods using OpenSSL if not:

![](resources/Ch5/40.png)

The methods aren't perfect by any means and more testing across a number of different certificate implementations are needed. Despite this, It is similar to the automated single analysis using MobSF and manual analysis with JADX but also allows for larger scale analysis of APK signatures.

This script is far from perfect or complete, but foundationally provided the basic methodology to extract specific information desired for large scale analysis. The usage of Splunk becomes useful in this context as the data contained in the text files can be ingested and parsed allowing for larger scale analysis in areas such as granular file changes in the embedded APKs, addition of URLs and IP addresses, and other anomalies. This writeup does not go into extensive detail into every specific use case but hopefully given enough time, effort, and data you can scale the application analysis methodology to suit your needs. Regardless of the implementation, Android APIs and APKs are changing frequently so ensure to retest solutions and manually spot check results to ensure it still fits the goal of the solution.
